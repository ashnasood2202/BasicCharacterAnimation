# ðŸ•º First Character Animation in Blender

Welcome to my first character animation project made using **Blender**! This project is a personal milestone in learning the fundamentals of 3D animation, character rigging, and using Blender's powerful toolset.

## ðŸŽ¥ Overview

The animation features a simple character performing a walk cycle with added squash and stretch effects for a cartoony feel. It highlights several foundational techniques in Blender animation.

## ðŸš€ Features & Techniques

- **Materials & Shading**
  - Used **Principled BSDF Shader** for realistic and stylized materials.
  - Custom material setup for the character mesh.

- **Animation**
  - **Keyframed motion** for character walk cycle.
  - **Parenting and Empties** used for organizing and controlling movement.
  - **Lattice Modifier** used for **squash and stretch**, enhancing motion dynamics.
  - **Shape Keys** added for facial expressions and mesh deformation.
  
- **Rigging**
  - Basic rigging setup for walk cycle.
  - Emphasis on movement flow rather than complex armature.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `character_animation.blend` â€“ Main Blender project file.
- `textures/` â€“ Any custom textures used (if applicable).
- `renders/` â€“ Preview images or animation frames.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

This project was created as part of my learning journey with Blender. The goal was to understand:
- How to animate a simple character
- Use of shape keys and lattice for expressive movement
- Basic rigging and keyframe workflows

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- **Blender 3.x** or newer  
- Basic understanding of Blender's interface and animation tools

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

- Managing animation using empties and parenting simplifies scene control
- Lattice modifiers are powerful for non-destructive deformation
- Shape keys add personality with minimal setup
